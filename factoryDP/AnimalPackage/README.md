# Factory Design Patterns

<p> <br/>
     The Factory Design Pattern is used to generate the objects.  <br/>
     It is a factory of objects to generate objects dynamically.   <br/>
     The object of derived classes are created based on the user input.  <br/>
     Ex:
        Animal Class is the base class.  <br/>
        We derive dog and cat class.     <br/>
        It is extensible by adding horse or lion classes as well.  <br/>
        This is the approach for Factory DP.  <br/>
