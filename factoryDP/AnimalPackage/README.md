# Factory Design Patterns

<p> The Factory Design Pattern is used to generate the objects.
     It is a factory of objects to generate objects dynamically.  
     The object of derived classes are created based on the user input.
     Ex:
        Animal Class is the base class. 
        We derive dog and cat class.
        It is extensible by adding horse or lion classes as well.
        This is the approach for Factory DP.
